layer:
  id: "landcover"
  description: |
      Landcover is used to describe the physical material at the surface of the earth. At lower zoom levels this is
      from Natural Earth data for glaciers and ice shelves and at higher zoom levels the [landcover is [implied by OSM tags](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Landcover). The most common use case for this layer
        is to style wood (`class=wood`) and grass (`class=`grass`) areas.
  buffer_size: 4
  fields:
    class: |
        More generalized groups of either `farmland`, `ice`, `wood`, `grass`
        or `wetland`.
        Use this to assign general colors to the landcover.
    subclass: |
        Original value of either the `landuse`, `natural`, `leisure` or
        `wetland` tag. Use this to do more precise styling.
