layer:
  id: "place"
  description: |
      The place layer consists out of [countries](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:place%3Dcountry),
      [states](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:place%3Dstate) and [cities](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:place).
      Apart from the roads this is also one of the more important layers to create a beautiful map.
      We suggest you use different font styles and sizes to create a text hierarchy.
  fields:
    name: The OSM [`name`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name) value of the POI.
    name_en: The english `name:en` value if available.
    class: |
        Distinguish between `country`, `state` and other city classes like
        `city`, `town`, `village`, `hamlet`, `suburb`, `neighbourhood` or `isolated_dwelling`.
        Use this to separately style the different places according to their importance (usually country and state different
        than cities).
    rank: |
        Countries, states and the most important cities all have a `rank` field ranging from `1` to `6` which
        marks the importance of the feature. Less important places do not have a `rank`.
        Use this to build a text hierarchy. The rank value originates from Natural Earth data and is either the
        original `scalerank` for cities or the original `labelrank` for countries and states.
