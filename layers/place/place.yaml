layer:
  id: "place"
  description: |
      The place layer consists out of [countries](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:place%3Dcountry),
      [states](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:place%3Dstate) and [cities](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:place).
      Apart from the roads this is also one of the more important layers to create a beautiful map.
      We suggest you use different font styles and sizes to create a text hierarchy.
  fields:
    name: The OSM [`name`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name) value of the POI.
    name_en: The english `name:en` value if available.
    class: |
        Distinguish between `country`, `state` and other city classes like
        `city`, `town`, `village`, `hamlet`, `suburb`, `neighbourhood` or `isolated_dwelling`.
        Use this to separately style the different places according to their importance (usually country and state different
        than cities).
    rank: |
        Countries, states and the most important cities all have a `rank` to boost their importance on the map.
        The `rank` field for counries and states ranges from `1` to `6` while the `rank` field for
        cities ranges from `1` to `10` for the most important cities and continues from `10` serially based
        on the local importance of the city (derived from population and city class).
        Use the `rank` field to build a text hierarchy.
        The rank value is a combination of the Natural Earth `scalerank`, `labelrank` and `datarank` values for countries
        and states and for cities consists out of a shifted Natural Earth `scalerank` combined with a local rank
        within a grid for cities that do not have a Natural Earth `scalerank`.
